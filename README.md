# System supported by Shell scriptsï¼š
1.GNU/Linux Debian...
2.Unix/MacOS
# How to use: 
Shell
directly put the script on the terminal to run, and the script will automatically activate the Apple device of the computer you link, which supports ios6-ios15 x. After activation, your screen will flash yellow and green alternately. If there is no change, it means that your device is not used in the environment where the SSH channel is opened. You can open the SSH channel first and then try it in the SSH channel opening tool developed by my dr238 team members. For the SSH system channel opening tool, please search dr238 in the search box for extraction.
Demo
The existing Demo needs to be used with binary assembly. After the Shell script comes out, it can be used directly
Thank You.
